Wow it's been three years and then some! Lets try to document this a bit. I was writing a templater in shell. There's a Makefile even! Not that it's of much use.

- Testing is done by `bats test`
- Building is done by executing the build script in `scripts/build`.

There's no live reload on dev no fancy CSS framework, Web Component, (P)React metaframework, or whatever because I don't need it. Or didn't want to need it.

Migrating to [`11ty`](https://www.11ty.dev/). I always loved the simplicity it gives. Plus, they have possums on the website.
