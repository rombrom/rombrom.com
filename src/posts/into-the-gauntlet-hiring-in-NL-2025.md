title: "Into the Gauntlet: gauging candidate caliber"
excerpt: As I was looking for new opportunities (as they say), I
  figured it'd be cool to document parts of the process.

Finding a job as a software developer is weird nowadays. I've heard stories of
companies with an amount of interview rounds that would put Dante's circles of
Hell to shame. Among these rounds is the now often-required (and dreaded)
technical assessment. I personally do not shame businesses employing this
method to find talent. In my own experience its somewhat of a necessity
because, especially in the age of LLMs, gauging a dev's knack can be especially
difficult.

There are multiple ways you can get a sense of the technical capabilities of a
dev. There's leetcode and other skill testing platforms (with or without
anti-LLM-cheat features), technical assessments, live coding and/or
whiteboarding, you name it.

The companies I have applied for currently all approach this issue differently,
each leveraging a different method. Out of these I can already say that I've
enjoyed the live coding assignments most. I believe this comes closest to
simulating the actual day-to-day for any role. Having an "expert" available for
questions and nudges, being able to have an actual dialogue, has been incredibly
valuable (and fun!) for me. You get a decent sense of how interactions will go in a
professional setting. I think this works the same way for the other side. An
added bonus here is that live coding with screen and camera sharing acts as a
"shield" against cheaters.

Another method companies like to employ are technical assessments in the form
of a small project. To goal is always to "see how you think" which I think is
in dissonance with the resulting artifact: they will judge "how you code" and
attempt to distill your thoughts from that. What I've found, having been on
both sides of the hiring process, is that this method can be decent but is
severely lacking in catching the nuances of collaboration and actual
day-to-day.

With a technical assessment, time and effort are usually offset to the
applicant. This can be unfair at times, but at the same time it's an
opportunity to get a better sense of how a company treats scope. As an example,
I recently completed an assessment where the goal was to create a "team budget
tracking" application. You can [find it on my
GitHub](https://github.com/rombrom/budgets-app-example). The company in
question follows the front-end/back-end split in role responsibilities. I
applied for a full-stack role. The projected time was 2 hours in the assessment
documentation. Over the phone they projected 2-4 hours. As it goes with
estimates, you should multiply the estimate by at least 4 to get into the
ballpark which potentially aligns with reality. I spent about a day total.

To anyone writing assessments: multiplying by 4 is "estimating 101." Be realistic
in what you expect from a candidate.

Now, in this instance I didn't really mind the discrepancy between expectation
and reality. I figured doing this assessment was: 1) a great opportunity for
keeping skills fresh, 2) a fantastic way to get something on my GitHub others
could look at, and last but not least 3) just plain fun to do.

I'm still in the process of evaluating some skill testing platforms some
potential employers have thrown at me. Generally I'm looking forward to doing
these as well, just to get a feel for the type of assessment and as a way for
me to gauge what a company feels are important competencies. I will update this
post about my thoughts after completing these.

After evaluating these approaches, if I were to set up a hiring process again,
I would make a strong case for doing live coding exercises. Either build out a
small feature or squash a bug. Both, preferably, set up as a case which closely
matches the type of work and/or project the role in question has to deal with.
I believe the nuances and layers of a personal, live, interactive assessment,
gives employers as well as candidates the most insight and feeling for whether
it's a match.
