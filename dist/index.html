    <h1>HI! This is an internet. It is made by Rommert Zijlstra</h1>

    <p>
      My previous place on the web hadn't been touched in well over 10 years.
      Sure, I've tried to re-ignite the engine lots of times but perfectionism
      always got the best of me. Now I just wanted to start and take anyone
      interested along for the ride. You can find my first post below.
    </p>

    <p>Take care,</p>

      <h2 id="writing-a-static-site-generator-in-bash-for-shts-and-giggles">Writing a static site generator in bash (for sh*ts and giggles)</h2>
<p>The current front-end ecosystem heavily flavors static site generation as the best way towards a performant site. Although static site generation has been around for a while, the current surge in interest is fuelled by popular and modern frameworks like <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a>, <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a>, etc. These are truly great products. And coupled with the JAM-stack philosophy touted by, among others, Netlify they are great choices for getting a speedy website up and running.</p>
<p>But all of these options require a heavy toolchain*—okay, “heavy” might be a too strong of a word in these cases save for maybe Gatsby. It got me thinking: has anyone ever tried to make a static site generator which uses the shell? A quick search yielded no results, so it’s either never been done, or just really not a popular choice. Let alone a wise one.</p>
<p>Regardless, I was curious as to whether it was possible. Last year I’ve been learning and using VIM on a daily basis. This has also led me down a path of learning all the cool shell programs most of us have installed on our machines by default. I find great joy in learning these and the potential tricks they can add to your workflows and there are really a lot of hidden gems in the dusty old <code>man</code> pages to be found.</p>
<p>* Please note that I don’t have any issues with the aforementioned toolchains. I snicker when I think of the “heaviest objects in the universe” joke as much as the next guy, but really, node and npm have made groundbreaking changes in the web landscape and I applaud them for that.</p>
<h3 id="exploration-of-the-problem-space">Exploration of the problem space</h3>
<p>Before we start clobbering our keyboard for incantations, lets think of some requirements a minimal static site generator needs to have to make it somewhat useful. We should at least support:</p>
<ul>
<li>template inheritance: I think current workflows heavily dictate a component-based approach. We want to have templates in which we can include other templates. Additionally it would be great if we could somehow extend base templates as well. Most grown-up template languages support these, so I think we should aim for the same.</li>
<li>basic data and variables: things like author, title, creation and/or modified date for any generated page. We don’t want to repeat ourselves, so these are a must. We might want to start with one datafile where we can house some globals like the site title, description and related settings. Further along the path we might want to think about handling folder or file-specific overrides.</li>
<li>collections and pages: ideally we’d want to introduce some ✨ magic ✨ which allows us to handle collections (like a <a href="https://xkcd.com/148/">blag</a>) and pages. It would be tedious to manually update a “latest posts” section for instance. We want the site generator to handle this.</li>
<li>last, we might want to add some more magic; writing in HTML is a tad awkward. Writing a markdown parser in bash maybe even more so. Maybe I want to add support for external parsing programs, like <a href="https://pandoc.org">pandoc</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>But there are some restrictions in our environment. We want to save people from <code>brew</code>ing, <code>apt-get</code>ting or <code>apk</code>-ing extra tools needed for this to work. We want to use programs which are used on practically every *NIX system, so: things like <code>cat</code>, <code>awk</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>sed</code> and the shell built-ins are allowed, but other programs like <code>envsubst</code> or <code>pandoc</code> are right out.</p>
<h4 id="attempts-successes-and-caveats">Attempts, successes and caveats</h4>
<p>Most “how-to” posts on the inter of nets feature a step-by-step explanation of how to make something work. Here I want to do something different. Programming doesn’t consist of a happy path. There are assumptions, pitfalls and mistakes we need to deal with on a daily basis, so I want to document these. Instead of a how-to this is literally a journal of working on this project. I’ll make assumptions, try ugly hacks, backtrack, re-implement, and take notes of any process or progress or lack thereof. Maybe you’ll learn something from this, I definitely did.</p>
<h3 id="get-templates-grep-for-includes-read-the-partial-with-sed">Get templates, grep for includes, read the partial with sed</h3>
<p>Let’s start with the template parser. My first thought was: we need a syntax which makes it clear that we’re including a template. Nothing final yet, but let’s go with <code>(&gt; path/to/file)</code> for now. The first task is to turn this into a regular expression (a proper parser might be more ideal, but lets try to keep it simple for now; it’s the shell man!). Then we loop through all <code>*.html</code> files in an arbitrary directory, see if we have matching include expressions, if so loop through the list of files and replace the include expression with its respective file contents.</p>
<p>This is where I stumbled upon something cool. If you’re somewhat familiar with <code>sed</code>, you probably know about the <code>s</code> function. But it’s much, much more than just a tool for replacing strings. It can also read files and write them to the address space with the <code>r</code> function.</p>
<pre><code>sed -e &#39;/pattern/r otherfile.txt&#39; somefile.txt</code></pre>
<p>This expression reads <code>otherfile.txt</code> (if it exists) and pastes its contents on the line below “pattern” in <code>somefile.txt</code>. Nifty! <code>sed</code> is even more powerful than that; you can branch to other expressions and use labels for GOTO-kind of functionality, but I digress. <code>sed</code> shines when doing line-based operations, but quickly becomes tedious if you want inline operations. In the case of inline partials for example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;(&gt; partial.html)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- sed will place contents here --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>That’s a bit awkward. Although we can technically introduce the limitation that any expression in our language needs to be on it’s own line this isn’t always desired. Why does <code>sed</code> do this? Let’s consult the manual.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Normally, sed cyclically copies a line of input, not including its terminating newline character, into a pattern space, (…), applies all of the commands with addresses that select that pattern space, copies the pattern space to the standard output, appending a new-line, and deletes the pattern space.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, so <code>sed</code> operates on any input line by line. What about the <code>r</code> function? I’ve marked the relevant bit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[1addr]r file Copy the contents of file to the standard output <em>immediately before the next attempt to read a line of input</em>. If file cannot be read for any reason, it is silently ignored and no error condition is set.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes making use of <code>sed</code>’s <code>r</code> function a bit awkward. We either need to transform the template which is currently being operated upon to always have newlines after a include expression, or we need to remove or escape any newlines in the partial before passing it’s contents to <code>s</code>.</p>
<p>Or maybe I just don’t know <code>sed</code> well enough. <a href="https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html">BRB</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>And I’m back. <a href="https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html">Bruce Barnett’s tutorial on <code>sed</code></a> provided some very useful information. Well, everything was also in the <code>man</code> page, but sometimes you need some examples and context and, well, different wording to grok something.</p>
<p>One of the better <code>sed</code> incantations I came up with was the following:</p>
<pre><code>output=&quot;$(sed -E -e &quot;/$re/ {
  r $path
  d
}&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;$output&quot;)&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It’s definitely somewhat more elegant than deleting the <code>$re</code> with <code>s</code> but unfortunately, due to <code>sed</code>’s line-based approach, it cannot paste content inline. We’ll need another solution for this. <code>sed</code> just isn’t going to work for this use-case.</p>
<h4 id="lets-get-awkward">Let’s get <code>awk</code>ward!</h4>
<p>So I’ve spent some days learning and tinkering. It became clear that <code>sed</code> wasn’t cut out for the task at hand. Luckily we have some more tools to our disposal. Enter <code>awk</code>.</p>
<p>I use <code>awk</code> sporadically to get shell scripts to output a specific column. This is especially handy when you’re working with server logs for example. Say you have a nginx server somewhere and you want some data on response codes: how many successes vs errors, for example. Depending on your log format, you could do this:</p>
<pre><code>zcat access.log.*.gz | awk &#39;{print $9}&#39; | sort -r | uniq -c | sort -r</code></pre>
<p>Which would give you the number of times a certain response code has been returned by nginx:</p>
<pre><code>   9199 200
   2919 500
   2888 304
   1703 429
   1425 404
    502 301
     39 206
     19 400
     10 302
      7 405
      4 403
      2 401</code></pre>
<p>Although I’ve read about <code>awk</code>’s small but powerful language, I mostly used it for scenario’s like that. Boy, was I in for a treat. Just like <code>sed</code>, <code>awk</code> operates on patterns, but it includes some more powerful functions to work with. As an added bonus, the syntax is a <em>lot</em> less obtuse than <code>sed</code>’s. For example, instead of <code>s/pattern/replacement/flags</code> we get proper functions like <code>sub(pattern, replacement, context)</code> and <code>gsub</code> (like <code>s/p/r/g</code>. Also, you can pass along variables to be used in your <code>awk</code> script by using the <code>-v</code> flag like thus:</p>
<pre><code>$ TEST=&quot;awesome&quot;
$ echo &#39;Hello, world!&#39; | awk -v str=&quot;$TEST&quot; &#39;{ gsub(/world/, str); print }&#39;</code></pre>
<p>But <code>awk</code>, like <code>sed</code>, just doesn’t like newlines—at least, the <code>awk</code> shipped with macOS. If our string contains one we get an error (note the literal newline; using a <code>\n</code> works):</p>
<pre><code>$ TEST=&quot;awsome
&quot;
$ echo &#39;Hello, world!&#39; | awk -v str=&quot;$TEST&quot; &#39;{ gsub(/world/, str); print }&#39;
awk: newline in string awesome
... at source line 1</code></pre>
<p>After some digging, I happened upon an issue from a terraform-helper from the hashicorp community in which user <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp-community/tf-helper/issues/1#issuecomment-490656096">fprimex found a super useful workaround</a>. Apparently <code>awk</code> keeps track of the arguments it’s called with in it’s <code>ARGV</code> array. <em>SWEET!</em> Now I think we have most of the pieces needed to make our first requirement work: <a href="https://github.com/rombrom/rombrom.com/blob/e91795ce39d297fed88353b37ccc54ead2af892c/scripts/build">parsing of templates</a>.</p>
